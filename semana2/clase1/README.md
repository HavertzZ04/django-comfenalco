### 📚 Class Summary

- In this class, we reviewed the activity from last week. 📝
- We practiced using console commands on the PC to create directories and files. 💻
- We also created virtual environments using `venv`. 🌐
- With Django, we created the superuser, a project directory and used commands like `django-admin startproject proyect_name`, `django-admin createsuperuser`, `python3 manage.py migrate`, `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `python3 manage.py runserver`. 🛠️
- Additionally, we generated the `requirements.txt` file using `pip freeze`. 📋
